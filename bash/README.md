# BASH Scripts

This directory contains standalone BASH shell scripts.

## Guidelines

- Each script should start with `#!/bin/bash`
- Include comments at the top describing what the script does
- Make scripts executable with `chmod +x script_name.sh`
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the script's purpose
- Include usage examples in comments if the script accepts arguments

## Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Example script that does something useful
# Usage: ./example.sh [argument]

echo "Script executed successfully"
```
